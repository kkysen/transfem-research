# Email to Compounding Pharmacies for High Concentration, Long-Lasting Injectable Estradiol Esters

Hi,

I was wondering what forms and concentrations of injectable estradiol esters you're able to make, particularly the longer-lasting esters like estradiol cypionate and estradiol enanthate.  Estradiol cypionate is commonly available as depo-estradiol, but that is at a low concentration of 5 mg/mL such that a 6 mg injection, for example, would be > 1 mL.  I've only been able to find a few out-of-state compounding pharmacies that can make it at 40 mg/mL, or at least 20 mg/mL, but shipping is difficult with them.  So are you able to make estradiol cypionate or enanthate at 40 (or at least 20) mg/mL in any standard carrier oil like castor or MCT oil?  Thank you!

Sincerely,
Khyber
