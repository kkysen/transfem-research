### Harvesting Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cells

<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5023582/>

Epithelial cells can be easily and non-invasively harvested from oral mucosa
simply by swabbing and scraping, as opposed to the standard biopsy
(of the oral mucosa, or more commonly, the dermis).

These have been used in corneal epithelial reconstruction already,
and could be potentially used vaginoplasty as an easy source of mucosal epithelial cells.
